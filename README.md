My First Neural Network with Synaptic JS - IRIS Dataset

## Iris Classification
Using the [Iris flower data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) to predict whether a flower is an 
1. **Iris setosa**
2. **Iris versicolor**
3. **Iris virginica**

based on its sepal and petal lengths and widths.

## Library

### [Synaptic.Js](https://github.com/cazala/synaptic) :
> Synaptic is a javascript neural network library for node.js and the browser, its generalized algorithm is architecture-free, so you can build and train basically any type of first order or even second order neural network architectures.
